# Python-Lessons

## Hello! 

This is a repository containing the files necessary to help you gain a better understanding of Python and computer programming through interactive lessons. I have made Python lessons available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCX8LYbO8WgS-kisv55CKPg/featured), but I realize that learning by <em>doing</em> is often the best way to learn in general.  

You will need to download the program to run these files, then save them to a folder in which you run them in order to complete the lessons in [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).


## Other Resources for Learning Python
[Quantopian Lecture Series](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures#Introduction-to-Python) (The first few lessons are good for Python, the rest are good for alogrithmic trading if that interests you!)  
[Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)  
[<em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em>](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy.pdf)

Not Python, but a good book on CS:
[<em>CS for Scientists and Engineers</em>](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/pub/CS5/WebHome/cs5book.pdf)
