## Other Resources for Learning Python
[Quantopian Lecture Series](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures#Introduction-to-Python) (The first few lessons are good for Python, the rest are good for alogrithmic trading if that interests you!)
[Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)
[<em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em>](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy.pdf)

Not Python, but a good book on CS:
